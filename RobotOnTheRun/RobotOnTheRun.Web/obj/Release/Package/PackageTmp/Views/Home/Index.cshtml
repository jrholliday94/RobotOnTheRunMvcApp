<h2>Robot on the Run</h2>

<p>
    Robot on the Run is a 2d platformer game. You play as a robot whose ship crashed on an alien planet. Part of the ship and yourself have broken off and been scattered all over the land.
    You must search through different terrain to collect them and rebuild your ship and yourself to fly home!

    As you progress in the game, you will find robotic parts to attatch to your character. These will give you extra skills like double jump that help you to complete the game. Hardcore players can attempt
    to collect all the collectible items to earn a high score. Finishing quickly adds to your score as well. Will you make it to the leaderboard?
